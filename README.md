## MixMatch using LXMERT

This is a repository for a [course](https://sites.google.com/view/cmpsci670) project where we attempted to use [MixMatch](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02249) dataset augmentation to improve performance on [NLVR2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00491) using a recently released multimodal transformer [LXMERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07490).

This repository has been forked from the excellent [original implementation](https://github.com/airsplay/lxmert) of LXMERT. After downloading the datasets, pretrained model and features from the original implementation's README links, the best way to explore this repository is `schedule_nlvr2.py` and `nlvr2_finetune_template_kalpesh.sh`.

A report for this project can be found [here](https://sumanvid97.github.io/docs/cv_report.pdf).
